                <p>First, take your time with a well-known game, or a small, yet genuinely useful app for language learning.
                    Links above.</p>
                <p>Now about me. <b>Maciej Bójko</b> is my name. For over a decade I'd been a journalist. My field of expertise
                    has been twofold: tech and science. I've written for <q>Gazeta Wyborcza</q>, <q>Dziennik</q> (before
                    it merged and became <q>Dziennik Gazeta Prawna</q>), <q>Focus</q>, <q>Do Rzeczy</q>, <q>Polska - the Times</q>,
                    Polska Agencja Prasowa, and others. As staff writer or freelancer. If you happen to recognize my name
                    - very cool. If not, ah well. Not surprising. I'm not exactly a celebrity.</p>
                <p>And I've decided that enough is enough. Time to reinvent myself, to decidedly change the career path. Let's
                    be honest: do you recollect reading <em>any</em> press articles about dramatic shortages of journalists?
                    About the huge market demand? About new newspapers and magazines launched, and thriving? About the business
                    booming? Yeah. Me neither. </p>
                <p>Therefore: programming (beside being a journalist, I'm also a mathematician, or at least that's what's written
                    on my bachelor's diploma). And, more specifically, front end development. I like the quirky JavaScript,
                    with its informal approach. I like the logic of HTML and CSS. I truly enjoy problem solving. All said,
                    the front end seems like a perfectly reasonable future career. And so I sat down, cracked a book open,
                    and started learning.</p>
                <p>Right now ("right now" equals January 2018) I've four months of commercial experience (at 
                    <a href="https://orba.co/">Orba</a>) under my belt. There, I've experienced all the usual frontend developer 
                    stuff, with grunt and gulp and yarn and webpack and bower, Bootstrap, SCSS and LESS, vanilla JS plus jQuery 
                    plus Underscore, Angular, AngularJS, Knockout.js. 
                </p>
                <p>Besides Polish, English, <em>some</em> French, Russian and Spanish (for varying values of <q>some</q>), I
                    speak HTML, CSS, JavaScript, some PHP and some SQL, I'm familiar with Git, Bootstrap, SASS, AngularJS, Angular, 
                    TypeScript, React, Redux, Gulp, Webpack and I'm adding new stuff to that list every week.</p>
                <p>So, now came the time to put some out my stuff out there. The site is intended to be permanently <em>in progress</em>.
                    I'll be putting more things here as soon as I can show them in public without feeling terribly ashamed.
                    But, what is here now, is this.</p>
                <p>The most recent things here would be: <a href="https://github.com/fervero/angulartris">Angulartris</a> 
                    and <a href="https://github.com/fervero/reactris">Reactris</a>, two ripoffs of Tetris written using Angular and React, 
                    respectively.</a>

                        <a href="https://fervero.github.io/numeros/">Numéros</a>

                    <a href="https://fervero.github.io/numeros/"><img src="img/numeros.png" alt="screenshot from the Numeros app" class="screenshot"></a>
                    <p>This project of mine was born out of a very specific need. See, as a part of that "reinvent myself" project,
                        I decided to learn some new foreign languages. First and foremost, French (and also Spanish). It's
                        hard! And one of numerous challenges is, understand spoken language. </p>
                    <p>With a sentence, with a piece of dialogue, a description, a story, if you missed something, if you didn't
                        hear right, if you don't know the word - you can still try infer the meaning from context. You might
                        even succeed, or be "close enough". With numbers, however, it isn't so. If you got it wrong, you're
                        doomed. With a phone number, there's no "close enough", there's no "I get the general meaning". And
                        the apps I found in the Google Play store were sadly limited. So I wrote one for myself.</p>
                    <p>Now, it isn't <em>exactly</em> cross-browser. The Web Speech API's support from platform to platform
                        is haphazard. Chrome's, for example, is uniformly excellent. Natural sounding voices, several supported
                        languages. No matter, Windows, Linux or mobile. With other browsers, however - hit and miss. What
                        languages will be supported, I can't know. The application must find out for itself, and handle it.
                        It does. I wrote three other language versions - the French is the basic - to increase the chance
                        that your browser will be able to say <em>something</em> at all. Writing an additional language controller
                        amounts to adding a dozen very straightforward lines. And that includes handling the fact that in
                        French, the telephone number is recited in groups of two digits (or so I've been led to believe),
                        and in English they say the date in the month-day-year order. I hope you appreciate the app's construction.</p>
                    <p>Now, it has also an AngularJS version. Same functionality, one&ndash;third less code.</p>

                    <p>This project of mine was inspired by an animated GIF, visualizing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity"
                            class="foreign-link">herd immunity</a>: basically, even if you yourself can't be vaccinated, <em>everyone else</em>                        (or close enough) being vaccinated will still protect you. You can see the original GIF <a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/8M7q8#J7LANQ4"
                            class="foreign-link">here</a>. I ran with the idea. I kept the original colors: blue for the vaccinated,
                        yellow for the unvaccinated, and red for the infected, dropped the <q>who was infected by whom</q>                        part of the graph &mdash; as it would only complicate the model with no real payoff &mdash; and wrote
                        the thing.</p>
                    <p>Generally, I prefer writing stuff that is genuinely useful, even if its scope of usefulness be very narrow.
                        Like <q>learn to recognize numbers spoken in French</q>, or <q>visualize how an infectious disease spreads</q>                        (I've heard of at least one teacher using my humble little app in class). I made some effort in order
                        to make the code reusable.</p>

                    <h3>The
                        <a href="https://fervero.github.io/html-tetris/">falling bricks game</a>
                    </h3>
                    <a href="https://fervero.github.io/html-tetris/"><img src="img/tetrx.png" alt="screenshot from the falling bricks game" class="screenshot"></a>
                    <p>That I decided to write as an exercise for myself. The clone of
                        <s>arguably</s> one of the best, most influential games ever. Of course you know it, and you know its
                        name, although I'm not sure if I'm allowed to use it, it is, after all, someone's trade mark. So
                        let's stay with "the falling bricks game".</p>
                    <p> To make it more "frontendy" (if I may be forgiven the <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuffySpeak"
                            class="foreign-link">Buffy speak</a>), I decided against using the canvas. Instead, it's all HTML
                        elements. Every basic square is a <code>div</code>. Not only it forced me to learn quite a lot about
                        positioning, it also had some unforeseen benefit. Calculating elements' sizes, positioning them,
                        even resizing the game itself (it goes up to 18 squares wide - purely an arbitrary choice) takes
                        very few lines of code! I make CSS, and the browser's engine, work for me. You can resize the browser,
                        with a game still in progress, and everything, the well, the bricks, the panels, etc. will be redrawn
                        to best fit the window. Come on, try it. And that required exactly zero lines of JavaScript.</p>
                        <p> Right now, it has three incarnations. <a href="https://github.com/fervero/html-tetris">The 
                            first one</a>, from early 2017, is written without any framework (jQuery doesn't count). No 
                            immutable objects, programming mostly imperative. Verbose, with lots of lines of code to do simple stuff, 
                            like handling the main game loop (where the brick falls down), which might get paused, or interrupted, or end.
                            It's simply not very good. (It isn't <em>completely</em> bad, either. It's just than I can do better now.)
                        </p> The <a href="https://github.com/fervero/reactris">second</a> and 
                        <a href="https://github.com/fervero/angulartris">third</a> ones I wrote in React and Angular, respectively.
                        Learned and re-learned a thing or two about functional programming, state management (including Redux), 
                        TypeScript, manipulating RxJS observables. I believe that comparing the old stuff with the newer 
                        shows some progress.

                    <p>Not much of a game, that. It was just me learning CSS animations. It's minimalist on purpose. One button,
                        which serves to start the game and then to pause it, no <q>game over</q> ever, no protection from
                        the player cheating and shooting when the game's paused. </p>
                    <p>Notice that the JavaScript is relatively short. The whole script takes some 70-odd lines. I tried to
                        make the CSS do for me as much work as possible.</p>
                    <p>I was also a little informal with the whole thing, UI and code both, although the latter is limited to
                        silly sounding names of functions and variables. I hope I'll be forgiven.</p>

                        <p>Some. I was a junior frontend developer at <a href="https://orba.co">Orba</a> since September
                            2017 until December 2017.

                        <p>Some. With AngularJS, Angular 4, Knockout.js, React.js. I don't claim mastership of any of them (<em>especially</em>Knockout and React), but neither am I a complete newbie. </p>

                            Well spotted, if you did spot that. It is not. The percents as units of distance cause some rounding errors, no matter how
                            many decimal places. It's a tradeoff I consciously accepted in exchange for the marvelous responsiveness.
                            I use some tricks here in order to mask that.
                            <code>Box-shadows</code>, mostly.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Coincidentally, the "shaking" (randomly rotating by a slight angle) the fallen bricks was not intended for that purpose.
                            I did it very early in the development process. Simply, I liked the aesthetics. I thought that
                            the squares, mimicking a haphazard pile of rocks, looked neat (by not looking neat). I hope you
                            agree.

                        Granted. It does. That was only an exercise, to help me master (OK, get to know) CSS animations. It was a conscious decision
                        to use relatively little JavaScript, and write as much of the functionality into CSS. I could make
                        it better with more JS (<em>modifying</em> the animations, instead of just
                        replacing classes and adding an occasional <code>translate</code> here and there &mdash; for starters),
                        but that was not the point of the exercise.

                        <p>About the <a href="numeros.html">Numéros</a> app, yes. Honest to blog. My recognition of rapidly
                            spoken numbers, in the language where "97" is pronounced as <i lang='fr'>quatre-vingt-dix-sept</i>                            (<q>four twenties-seventeen</q>), noticeably improved. Feel free to use it, if you happen to
                            have the same problem that I did. Hey, for all I know you could have a foreign friend in the
                            process of learning Polish. Maybe they'll find my little app useful.</p>

                    <dd>It's short for <em>Ferocious Veldt Roarer</em>. It's inspired by George R. R. Martin, of the <q>A Song of Ice And Fire</q>                        fame. I needed a nickname for the <a href="http://asoiaf.westeros.org/" class="foreign-link">Westeros.org</a>                        discussion board, and to steal one from a book by GRRM seemed fitting. I'm not explaining the joke
                        further, but I do recommend reading his <q>Tuf Voyaging</q>.</dd>
